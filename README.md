## Introduction

This repository contains a set of pre-built dbt Load and Transform models for common SaaS applications to create an integrated ("conformed") data warehouse dimensional model. In its current incarnation it supports Google BigQuery as the target data warehouse with Stitch (primarily), Fivetran and Segment (for certain sources) as the data pipeline technology.

See the [https://github.com/rittmananalytics/ra_data_warehouse/wiki](project wiki) for full documentation.
